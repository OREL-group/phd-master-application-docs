### Application materials for universities in the US
Hi - I'm [Vincent](vsitzmann.github.io). I'm from Germany originally, but came to the United States for a Master in Computer Science at Stanford University, and went on to do my PhD there as well.

Here, I'm publishing my application documents for my Masters and my PhD, such that they may serve as a resource for folks in similar situations.

I don't mean to imply that my documents are particularly well written, and I certainly do **not** recommend that you copy their structure or their content 1:1 - your application likely needs to look different. However, maybe you might be able to take away some principles or some ideas that are useful also in your writing of your application documents. Good luck!
